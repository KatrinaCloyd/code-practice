# Code Practice 

A place to keep, play, and practice with general code challenges. Including tests with functions from actual interviews, review info, and more. Will continue to grow!  

## Review File

Here there are multiple files that go over the basics of arrays, objects, strings, and a few simple examples of each. Just live serve the index.html file, and open the console in the browser to see the console logs from the named script file. Remember to change the script file in the index file to serve the various files here. 

## Functions File

Holds verious functions and their tests. These are actual interview questions, some are from Leet code, or codewars, or other various sources. Sources will be noted at the top of each function file.
